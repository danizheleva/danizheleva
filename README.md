<h1  align="center"> Hi there 👋 I'm Dani  </h1>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my online portfolio using React and Gatsby. Check out the code [here](https://github.com/danizheleva/portfolio), and the deployed version [here](https://danielazheleva.gatsbyjs.io/blog). It's very early days, so don't judge just yet!  
  
- 📚 I’m currently reading [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/) and [The Power of Georgraphy](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-power-of-geography/tim-marshall/9781783966028). Connect with me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27248898-daniela) if you're a keen reader!  
  
- 💬 Ask me about... life at a start up, my favorite book, pretty much anything, happy to connect! (Would be even happier if you throw a cat meme into the opening message)
